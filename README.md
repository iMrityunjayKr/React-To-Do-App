- ✅ Mark a task as complete (strikethrough on click)
- ✅ Delete a task
- ✅ Data persistence with localStorage
- ✅ Prevents adding empty tasks

## What I Learned

- **State management** — choosing the right data type for each `useState` variable
- **Immutable state updates** — never mutating arrays directly, always creating new copies
- **Array methods** — using `filter` to delete and `map` to transform todos
- **Event bubbling** — using `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent child clicks from triggering parent handlers
- **Controlled inputs** — binding `value={state}` so React owns the input
- **localStorage** — persisting data with `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse`
- **useEffect** — syncing state changes to localStorage via the dependency array
